# Flickr Image Search App

A simple iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to search for and view images from Flickr's public feed. The app fetches images based on user-provided search terms and displays them in a grid. Users can tap on any image to view detailed information, including the image, title, description, author, published date and dimensions.
